# Reddit AMA Sentiment Analysis


Start by reading the tutorial for this repo: [Sentiment Analysis of Reddit AMAs](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/2016/03/10/sentiment-analysis-of-reddit-amas/) which explains how to use Apache Spark, Cloudant, and Watson Tone Analyzer to perform sentiment analysis on a reddit Ask Me Anything web event.

Then move on to the follow-up tutorial [Sentiment Analysis of Reddit AMAs using dashDB and R](https://wp.me/p6nwVO-22T), which shows an alternate output. Move Cloudant JSON data on to a dashDB warehouse, then use built-in analysis tool R to glean meaning and insights.

Interested in SparkR?  Read the third tutorial in this series, which shows how to [connect to Cloudant via CouchDB then analyze the JSON with SparkR](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/2016/08/15/reddit-sentiment-analysis-in-sparkr-and-couchdb/).
